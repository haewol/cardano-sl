## Building

Build the project with stack on the command line:

```bash
stack build
```

## Testing

Test the project with stack on the command line:

```bash
stack test
```

## Developing with ghcid

While developing, you can run ghcid in its own terminal to typecheck the project every time it is saved:

```bash
make ghcid
```

In addition to typechecking, you can have ghcid run tests as well with:

```bash
make ghcid-test
```
